# lande_detection

This repository contains an approach to detect lanes in an image with polynomials and tracks the parameters with an array of Kalman filters.

## How to use

The repository contains a simulation of artifical images, but the lane detection approach can also be used with real world images. Further information will be given up next.

### Simulation of artifical images

To generate the artifical images
